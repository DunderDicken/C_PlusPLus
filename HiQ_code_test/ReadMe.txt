== Simulator for radio controlled cars ==

This program is a simple simulator for a remote controlled car.

A few assumptions where made in creating this program:

* Assumptions *
- More types of cars will be added in the future.
- Different types of cars will have different areas, forward and backwards speed and 
  will turn different amounts of degrees with one 'turn'-command.
- All cars of the same type (i.e 'monster truck') will have the same area, speeds and turning ratio.
- No map of the room needed to printed during the simulation.
